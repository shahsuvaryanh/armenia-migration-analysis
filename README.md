# armenia-migration-analysis
Data visualization project on employment conditions and migration in Armenia.

## Overview
Migration in Armenia is often attributed to unemployment, but this project shows that **job quality, wage inequality, and dissatisfaction among employed individuals** are major drivers of both actual migration and migration intent.

The analysis combines:
- Income trends of Armenian labor migrants (2019–2023)
- Migration intentions of the general population (2013–2024)

Together, these perspectives provide a comprehensive view of migration as an economic strategy rather than a response to joblessness.

## Research Question
How do working conditions influence migration patterns and income disparities among Armenian labor migrants?

## Data Sources
- Armenian Statistical Committee (ArmStat)
- CRRC Armenia / Caucasus Barometer
- Trading Economics

Publicly available labor force and migration survey data were merged and cleaned for multi-year analysis.

## Methodology
- Descriptive and temporal trend analysis of migration flows
- Demographic and educational profiling of migrants
- Analysis of employment status, job satisfaction, and migration intent
- Income distribution and inequality analysis
- Visualization-driven storytelling using **R and RMarkdown**

## Key Findings
- Migration is concentrated among **working-age adults (25–44)**, creating long-term labor force risks
- A large share of migrants are **employed but dissatisfied**, challenging the unemployment-only narrative
- Job-related reasons account for **50–70%** of long-term migration cases
- Income inequality among migrants persists despite stable median wages
- Russia remains the dominant destination for Armenian migrants (~85–90%)
- Migration intent is significantly higher among individuals reporting **low job satisfaction**

## Implications
The findings suggest that reducing migration pressures in Armenia requires:
- Improving job quality, not just job availability
- Addressing wage inequality and career growth limitations
- Strengthening labor protections and employment stability

Without structural labor market reforms, migration is likely to remain a rational economic response for many Armenians.
